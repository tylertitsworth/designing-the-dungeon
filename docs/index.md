# Designing the Dungeon

A digital garden where I share my successes, my failures, and my ideas about Dungeons and Dragons. This garden isn't limited to just Fantasy Tabletop Roleplaying though, and I'm going to take some liberties to explore some other topics I'm passionate about, from Software Engineering, DevOps, and other technologies to writing, synthesizers, and board games.

This isn't like a normal blog because each post is treated like its own world to explore. It's root will grow in different directions as I travel down the rabbit hole to nurture the value of the information as I learn and experience it. Some of these posts might not turn out like others, but a select few may contain something worth sharing with others.

## On the Shoulders of Giants

I'm not the first person to come up with this idea and I'm learning from great works like [The Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/), [Memento](https://m0wer.github.io/memento/), and [many more](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). I'm not even the first person to talk about Dungeons and Dragons in this way whether it's the [Angry GM](https://theangrygm.com/) or [MCDM](https://www.mcdmproductions.com/about).

The reason that I'm making this is the same reason any of the above have done it, because it might just reach someone who needs it, and they need an outlet to share their experiences. I've been a Dungeon Master for over a decade and I take the role very seriously. I've had a lot of ideas over the years and I wanted to catalog what I've done so I can remember it and continue to share it with others.
