Following the digital garden format, each project is like a plant in a different stage in its life cycle depending on the amount of effort I've spent on it.

# Seeds

These are raw basic ideas that may one day become a project.

## Atmospheric Synth

I have a Behinger Crave and Edge now along with a DAW for my audio setup, and I've been able to create some interesting sounds, but I haven't actually figured out how I'm going to make the atmospheric sounds I want to use in my D&D games or just as background music. I need a workflow of some kind.

## Complete E2E Intel MLOps Pipeline

I'm on the AI MLOps team at Intel, and that makes the face of MLOps at Intel, but unfortunately we haven't actually made a complete e2e pipeline, having many attempts to creating something similar to it a couple of us are working on organizing a project that achieves a complete pipeline. Such a pipeline is something that I've wanted to achieve for a long time since I've started really taking MLOps seriously but it's not something I can do alone.

## Dark Torch

A Torchbearer 2e Campaign that's been modified to work in the Dark Sun D&D campaign setting. I love Dark Sun, and I bought 2/3 of the Torchbearer books and I'm very intrigued with the system.

## D&D 4e Compendium Revival

Another 4e community member has made a lot of progress on an electron compendium app, and I want to help contribute in making it open source.

# Seedlings

A project that isn't more than a draft, but some thought has been put into it and the organization/administration/architecture has been written.

## Designing the Dungeon

You're reading it, and I'm working on this project every so often to fill out my catalog but until I feel that this website is presentable it's still a seedling.

# Growing

A Project under active development that is currently running.

## 5th Age Marmadas

An in-person D&D campaign set as the sequel to the 4th Age of Marmadas, a long running Dungeons and Dragons campaign set in the homebrew forgotten realms setting's continent of Marmadas. This project uses the 5th Age SRD and has a suite of tools to aid play.

## Dungeonscape

An online D&D 4e campaign played over roll20 and discord consisting of a megadungeon built over the course of 2023 as part of the [d23](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dungeon23/) event.

## [IntelÂ® AI Containers](https://github.com/intel/ai-containers)

This is primary codebase that my work goes into. This project isn't the only project that I work on at Intel, but it's the one that I care about enough to put into my garden.

# Dormant

A project that has temporarily stopped. The work done on that project is still useful even though nothing more is happening.

## [5th Age SRD](https://tylertitsworth.github.io/5th-age-srd/)

An adaption of the 13th Age Archmage Engine combined with more elements from Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition and 5th Edition.

## [5th Age Monster Builder](https://github.com/tylertitsworth/5th-age-monster-builder)

A GUI for building monsters in the 5th Age Engine.

## [Multi Mediawiki RAG](https://github.com/tylertitsworth/multi-mediawiki-rag)

A simple RAG chatbot that can retrieve from a mediawiki data dump. Effectively a D&D Chatbot.

## [d23](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dungeon23/)

I spent 10/12 months of 2023 building a megadungeon. 2-4 hours per week every sunday making rooms, one floor per month. Eventually I started the Dungeonscape campaign based on this dungeon and paused my work on the final floors.

## Farscape

An online D&D 4e Campaign set in the homebrew forgotten realms that accompanies Marmadas, but instead it's a planar game! Played over roll20 for a couple years, this game has been halted because the original premise was to switch GMs every single game, however, this was not sustainable.

## No More Watchmen

An online D&D 5e Campaign set in the homebrew forgotten realms setting's continent of Marmadas taking place at the same time as the events of Dungeonscape. Played over roll20, the group of new players that I onboarded seemed to really enjoy the game, however, overtime the burden of learning the system was too much for some players, and too easy for others. The campaign was eventually paused.

# Dying

The people or the components that make up this project are gone and the project can't be grown again.

## 4th Age Marmadas

An in-person D&D 5e campaign set in the homebrew forgotten realms setting's continent of Marmadas. Many of the stories and people who played this game have distanced themselves from my current play group.

# Dead

The project and its contributions are no longer used or very relevant.

## [Zombie Animator](https://github.com/tylertitsworth/zombie-animator)

Compiler built in C++/Flex/Bison for the [Zombie-Oriented Machine-Being Interface Engine](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/zombie.html), aptly called the animator, rather than assembler. I originally made this project because I really wanted to get more experience with compilers.
